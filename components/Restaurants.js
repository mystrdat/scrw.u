      <p>Corkscrew doesn't just tell you to order white wine with your fish. We use the real wine lists from hundreds of restaurants in the UK (mostly London for the time being), with many more added every week. Don't think of it as a wine app, think of it as the wine list reimagined for the age of mobile devices and ubiquitous internet.</p>
